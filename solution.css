The solution involves replacing the `:has()` selector with a more precise selector that directly targets the immediate child.  This avoids the unintended consequences of `:has()`'s broader scope.

```css
.parent > .child-element {
  color: blue;
}
.parent > .child-element + .parent {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
.parent .other-child {
  color: green;
}
```

This revised CSS uses the `>` child combinator to ensure that only direct children of `.parent` are considered.  This approach is more predictable and aligns with the intended behavior.
